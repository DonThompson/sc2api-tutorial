# sc2api-tutorial
Starcraft 2 API Tutorial Bot - with some upgrades of my own

# How to use?
* Starcraft 2 API Here:  https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api
* Follow the building doc:  https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api/blob/master/docs/building.md
* This repo contains just the single tutorial.cc file which will be in your /s2client-api/examples/ folder
* Overwrite it, set 'tutorial' as the startup project, and fire it up

This tutorial implements the first three tutorials, along with some upgraded systems of my own design along the way.
